## Receiving Payments as SRL

### Overview

To receive income legally as an SRL (Limited Liability Company) in Romania, you need to:
1. Issue invoices (facturi)
2. Declare income to ANAF
3. Pay corporate taxes
4. Optionally pay yourself dividends

### Payment Methods by Revenue Source

#### 1. Donations (Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, PayPal)

**How it works**:
- Users donate via platform (PayPal, Stripe)
- Platform takes 3-5% fee
- Funds arrive in your PayPal/Stripe account
- Transfer to SRL bank account

**SRL Accounting**:
1. **Receive payment**: Transfer from PayPal → SRL bank account
2. **Issue invoice**: Self-invoice or revenue receipt (chitanță)
3. **Declare**: Include in quarterly VAT declaration (if VAT registered)
4. **Tax**: Pay 1-3% corporate tax (micro-company regime)

**Key Question**: Are donations taxable income?
- **If positioned as "tip/donation"**: May be non-taxable (check with accountant)
- **If positioned as "payment for service"**: Taxable as service revenue
- **Recommendation**: Position as "voluntary support" but declare as revenue to be safe

**Documents Needed**:
- Monthly bank statement showing PayPal transfers
- PayPal/Stripe transaction reports
- Self-invoices or revenue receipts (chitanțe)

---

#### 2. Affiliate Commissions (XTB, Trading212, etc.)

**How it works**:
- Broker sends monthly commission report
- Broker may issue invoice TO you or require you to invoice THEM
- Payment via bank transfer (usually EUR or RON)

**SRL Accounting**:

**Option A: Broker invoices you** (you receive invoice from them)
1. Receive invoice from broker (e.g., "XTB sends you invoice for €500 commission")
2. Register as expense? NO - this is income to you
3. Actually: Broker should issue a **payment notice**, not invoice
4. You issue **invoice TO broker** for services rendered
5. Receive payment to SRL bank account
6. Declare as revenue

**Option B: You invoice broker** (most common)
1. Broker sends commission report (e.g., "You earned €500 this month")
2. **You issue invoice** to broker:
   - Invoice to: XTB (their company details)
   - Service: "Affiliate marketing services - {month}"
   - Amount: €500 (or RON equivalent)
   - VAT: Add 19% if you're VAT registered, exempt if micro-company
3. Send invoice to broker
4. Receive payment to SRL bank account
5. Declare in quarterly reports

**VAT Considerations**:
- **Micro-company (<€25,000 revenue)**: VAT exempt
- **Standard SRL (>€25,000)**: Must charge 19% VAT
- **Reverse charge**: If broker is in EU, may use reverse charge (no VAT, they handle it)

**Documents Needed**:
- Commission reports from broker
- Invoices you issued
- Bank transfer confirmations
- Contract/agreement with broker

---

#### 3. Google AdSense

**How it works**:
- Google pays monthly (if >$100 threshold)
- Payment via bank transfer or Western Union
- Google issues payment report (not formal invoice)

**SRL Accounting**:
1. Receive payment from Google to SRL bank account
2. Download monthly payment report from AdSense
3. **Self-invoice** or treat as revenue receipt:
   - Invoice from: Google Ireland Ltd (VAT IE6388047V)
   - Service: "Online advertising revenue"
   - Amount: As per AdSense report
4. Declare as revenue
5. VAT: **Reverse charge** applies (B2B service from Ireland, you handle VAT)

**Documents Needed**:
- AdSense monthly payment reports
- Bank transfer confirmations
- Self-invoice or revenue receipt

**Reverse Charge VAT**:
- You don't pay VAT to Google
- You declare VAT on purchase (input) AND sale (output) - cancels out
- Net effect: 0 VAT owed, but must be declared if VAT registered

---

#### 4. Premium Features (Stripe Payments)

**How it works**:
- User pays €20 via Stripe
- Stripe takes 1.5-2.9% fee + €0.25
- Funds settle in Stripe account
- Transfer to SRL bank account daily/weekly

**SRL Accounting**:
1. User payment: €20 via Stripe
2. Stripe fee: €0.60
3. Net received: €19.40
4. **Issue invoice** to customer:
   - If B2C (individual): Invoice with 19% VAT included (if VAT registered)
   - If B2B (company): Invoice with VAT or reverse charge
   - Amount: €20 (incl. VAT if applicable)
5. Transfer from Stripe → SRL bank account
6. Declare as revenue

**Automation**:
- Stripe can auto-generate invoices
- Integrate with Romanian e-factura system (if VAT registered)
- Use accounting software (e.g., SmartBill, Fiago) for automatic invoice generation

**Documents Needed**:
- Stripe transaction reports
- Invoices issued (auto-generated or manual)
- Bank transfer confirmations

**See detailed implementation guide below**: "Premium Upgrade System Implementation"

### Tax Obligations for SRL

#### Micro-Company Regime (Recommended for Year 1-2)

**Eligibility**:
- Revenue < €500,000/year
- Not in restricted activities (banking, insurance, gambling)
- At least 1 employee or shareholder-manager

**Tax Rate**:
- **1%** on revenue if you have employees
- **3%** on revenue if no employees (just shareholder-manager)

**Example** (Year 1: €2,000 revenue):
- Tax: €2,000 × 3% = €60
- Declare quarterly, pay quarterly
- Very simple accounting

**Dividend Distribution**:
- After paying corporate tax, remaining profit can be distributed as dividends
- Dividend tax: 8% (paid by shareholder, not SRL)
- Example: €2,000 revenue → €60 tax → €1,940 profit → distribute €1,940 → pay 8% (€155) → net €1,785

#### Standard SRL Regime (If Revenue > €500k)

**Tax Rate**:
- **16%** corporate income tax on profit (revenue - expenses)
- More complex accounting, can deduct expenses

---

### Practical Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Open SRL Bank Account
- Choose bank: ING, BCR, BRD, Revolut Business
- Open business account (cont curent firmă)
- Get IBAN for receiving payments

#### Step 2: Set Up Payment Processors

**For Donations**:
1. Create Buy Me a Coffee account
2. Link to PayPal or Stripe
3. Add bank details for payouts
4. Set payout to SRL bank account (not personal)

**For Affiliates**:
1. Apply to broker affiliate programs (need SRL details)
2. Provide SRL bank IBAN for payments
3. Agree on invoicing process (you invoice them monthly)

**For Stripe (Premium)**:
1. Create Stripe account: [stripe.com/ro](https://stripe.com/ro)
2. Verify SRL (provide CUI, registration certificate)
3. Add SRL bank account for payouts
4. Enable auto-invoicing (if VAT registered)

**For AdSense**:
1. Create AdSense account
2. Provide SRL details
3. Add bank account for payments (USD or EUR)
4. Set threshold to $100 minimum

#### Step 3: Accounting & Invoicing

**Option A: Hire Accountant** (Recommended)
- Cost: €50-150/month for micro-company
- They handle all invoicing, declarations, tax filings
- Worth it for peace of mind

**Option B: DIY with Software**
- Use: SmartBill, Fiago, Saga
- Generate invoices, track revenue
- Still need accountant for quarterly declarations

#### Step 4: Monthly Process

1. **Receive payments** → SRL bank account
2. **Issue invoices** (or have accountant do it)
3. **Track revenue** in spreadsheet or software
4. **Quarterly**: Declare revenue to ANAF, pay tax
5. **Annually**: File financial statements, decide on dividends

### Key Documents to Keep

| Document | Purpose | Retention |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Invoices issued | Proof of revenue | 10 years |
| Bank statements | Payment proof | 10 years |
| Payment processor reports | Reconciliation | 10 years |
| Affiliate commission reports | Support invoices | 10 years |
| Tax declarations | ANAF compliance | 10 years |
| Contracts/agreements | Legal protection | Indefinite |

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **❌ Mixing personal & business accounts**: Always use SRL bank account
2. **❌ Not issuing invoices**: Every revenue transaction needs documentation
3. **❌ Forgetting VAT**: If you cross €25k threshold, must register for VAT
4. **❌ Not declaring PayPal income**: ANAF can see all bank transfers
5. **❌ Missing quarterly deadlines**: Late declarations = penalties
6. **❌ DIY accounting errors**: Hire accountant if unsure - worth €100/mo

---

### Questions to Ask Your Accountant

Before starting monetization:

1. Should we register for VAT immediately or wait until threshold?
2. For PayPal donations, can we position as "non-taxable gifts" or must declare as revenue?
3. For EU affiliate commissions (XTB), do we use reverse charge?
4. Should we issue self-invoices for AdSense or just revenue receipts?
5. What accounting software do you recommend for our setup?
6. Can you handle Stripe auto-invoicing integration?

- Low price = low risk for users

---

### Implementation: PDF Export (MVP Premium Feature)

#### User Flow

1. User completes calculation
2. Sees "💾 Export as PDF - €5" button
3. Clicks → Redirects to Stripe Payment Link
4. Pays €5 with card
5. Stripe redirects back with success
6. Download PDF automatically

#### Technical Implementation

**Step 1: Create Stripe Product**
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard
1. Products → Create Product
2. Name: "PDF Export - Tax Calculation"
3. Price: €5 (one-time)
4. Create Payment Link
5. Copy link: https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx
```

**Step 2: Add Button to App**
```javascript
// In displayResults() function (app.js)
html += '<div style="margin-top: 20px;">';
html += '  <button onclick="exportPDF()" class="btn-premium">';
html += '    💾 Export as PDF - €5';
html += '  </button>';
html += '</div>';

function exportPDF() {
  // Option A: Direct to Stripe (no backend)
  window.location.href = 'https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx?client_reference_id=' + Date.now();

  // Option B: With backend (generate PDF after payment)
  // Store calculation data in localStorage
  localStorage.setItem('pendingPDF', JSON.stringify(getFormData()));
  window.location.href = 'https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx?client_reference_id=' + Date.now();
}
```

**Step 3: Handle Payment Success**
```javascript
// After Stripe redirects back to site
// URL: https://impoziteonline.ro/?payment=success

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  if (urlParams.get('payment') === 'success') {
    // Retrieve calculation data
    const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pendingPDF'));

    // Generate PDF (client-side with jsPDF)
    generatePDF(data);

    // Clean up
    localStorage.removeItem('pendingPDF');
  }
});

function generatePDF(data) {
  // Use jsPDF library
  const { jsPDF } = window.jspdf;
  const doc = new jsPDF();

  doc.setFontSize(16);
  doc.text('Calculul Impozitelor - ' + ACTIVE_TAX_YEAR, 20, 20);

  doc.setFontSize(12);
  doc.text('Total Impozit: ' + data.totalTax.toFixed(2) + ' RON', 20, 40);
  doc.text('CASS: ' + data.cass.toFixed(2) + ' RON', 20, 50);
  // ... add all calculation details

  doc.save('impozite-' + ACTIVE_TAX_YEAR + '.pdf');
}
```

**Step 4: Add Invoice Generation**

Stripe can automatically generate invoices, but for Romanian compliance:

**Option A: Stripe Invoices** (Simple)
- Enable "Email invoices" in Stripe dashboard
- Stripe sends invoice to customer
- Download from Stripe for your records

**Option B: Romanian E-Factura** (Compliant)
- Use SmartBill API to generate Romanian invoice
- Trigger via Stripe webhook
- Email to customer

```javascript
// Backend webhook handler (Cloudflare Worker / Vercel Function)
export default async function handler(req) {
  const event = await stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    req.body,
    req.headers['stripe-signature'],
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  );

  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object;

    // Generate invoice via SmartBill API
    const invoice = await smartbill.createInvoice({
      client: {
        email: session.customer_details.email,
        name: session.customer_details.name,
      },
      products: [{
        name: 'PDF Export - Tax Calculation',
        price: 5,
        quantity: 1,
        vat: 19 // if VAT registered
      }]
    });

    // Email invoice to customer
    await sendEmail(session.customer_details.email, invoice.pdf);
  }
}
```

### Invoicing Users Directly: Legal Requirements

#### For B2C (Individual Customers)

**What you must include in invoice**:
- ✅ Your SRL details: Name, CUI, address, bank account
- ✅ Customer name and email (address optional for B2C)
- ✅ Invoice number (sequential: 2026001, 2026002, etc.)
- ✅ Invoice date
- ✅ Service description: "Servicii software online - Export PDF"
- ✅ Price per unit: €5
- ✅ Quantity: 1
- ✅ Subtotal: €5
- ✅ VAT (19% if registered): €0.95
- ✅ **Total: €5.95** (if VAT registered) or €5 (if not)
- ✅ Payment method: "Stripe / Card"
- ✅ Payment status: "Paid"

**VAT Considerations**:

**If Micro-Company (<€25k revenue)**:
- ❌ NOT VAT registered
- Invoice: €5 (no VAT)
- Mention: "Scutit de TVA conform Art. 310 Cod Fiscal"

**If VAT Registered (>€25k revenue)**:
- ✅ Must charge 19% VAT
- Invoice: €5 + €0.95 VAT = €5.95
- Must remit €0.95 to ANAF quarterly

**Recommendation**: Stay under €25k in Year 1 to avoid VAT complexity

---

#### For B2B (Company Customers)

**Additional requirements**:
- ✅ Customer company name, CUI, address
- ✅ Customer VAT registration number (if applicable)
- ✅ Reverse charge (if customer is VAT registered)

**Reverse Charge VAT**:
- If both you and customer are VAT registered
- You don't charge VAT on invoice
- Customer handles VAT themselves
- Invoice: €5 (mention "Taxare inversă Art. 331 Cod Fiscal")

### Automated Invoice Generation Options

**Why SmartBill**:
- ✅ Romanian e-factura compliant

- ✅ Generates invoices, sends via email
- ✅ Integrates with ANAF (SPV system)
- ✅ €15-30/month

**Setup**:
```javascript
// SmartBill API integration
const smartbill = require('smartbill-api');

smartbill.authenticate({
  username: process.env.SMARTBILL_USERNAME,
  token: process.env.SMARTBILL_TOKEN
});

// Generate invoice
const invoice = await smartbill.createInvoice({
  series: 'PDF',
  client: {
    name: customerName,
    email: customerEmail,
    isTaxPayer: false // B2C customer
  },
  products: [{
    name: 'Export PDF - Calcul Impozite',
    code: 'PDF-EXPORT',
    price: 5,
    quantity: 1,
    vat: 0, // No VAT if micro-company
    saveToDb: false
  }],
  currency: 'EUR',
  isDraft: false,
  sendEmail: true // Auto-send to customer
});

console.log('Invoice generated:', invoice.number);
```

**Cost**: €15-30/month (depending on volume)

---

---

#### Option 3: Manual (Low Volume)

If you have <50 invoices/month:

- €10/month

### Complete Payment-to-Invoice Flow

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **User pays €5 via Stripe**
   - Stripe checkout page
   - Card payment processed
   - Stripe fee: €0.18 (3.4% + €0.25 for EU cards)
   - Net: €4.82

2. **Stripe webhook triggers backend**
   - Webhook event: `checkout.session.completed`
   - Extract customer email, amount

3. **Backend generates invoice via SmartBill**
   - API call to SmartBill
   - Invoice created: PDF-0001
   - SmartBill emails invoice to customer

4. **Backend unlocks feature or sends PDF**
   - Option A: Store "premium user" in database
   - Option B: Send PDF download link via email
   - Option C: Generate PDF on-the-fly

5. **Stripe transfers funds to SRL bank**
   - Daily/weekly payout
   - €4.82 arrives in bank account

6. **Accountant handles quarterly declaration**
   - Revenue: €5
   - Stripe fee: €0.18 (expense)
   - Net revenue: €4.82
   - Tax (3%): €0.14

**Your take-home** (after corporate + dividend tax):
- €5 revenue → €0.18 Stripe → €0.14 tax → €4.68 profit
- Distribute as dividend: €4.68 → 8% tax (€0.37) → **€4.31 net**
