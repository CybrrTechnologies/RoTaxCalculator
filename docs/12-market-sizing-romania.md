**Note**: No official total published. Estimate of 200,000-300,000 declared contracts is reasonable.

**Undeclared Rentals**: Surveys suggest only ~30-50% of landlords register with ANAF.

---

### 1.5 PFA (Self-Employed / Sole Proprietors)

| Source | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| ChatGPT estimate | ~380,000-430,000 | Active PFA/II/IF combined |

### 1.6 SRL (Limited Liability Companies)

| Source | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|

| - Foreign | ~50,000-100,000 | Must file (no withholding) |

**Note**: Significant overlap with stock investors.

---

## 2. CASS Threshold Corrections

**ChatGPT stated**: CASS threshold = 48,000 RON/year

**ACTUAL (2026)**: CASS thresholds differ by income type!

### Investment Income CASS (Stepped System)

| Net Income | CASS Due |
|------------|----------|
| < 24,300 RON (6 MW) | 0 RON |
| 24,300 - 48,600 RON | 2,430 RON |
| 48,600 - 97,200 RON | 4,860 RON |
| > 97,200 RON | 9,720 RON |

### PFA CASS (Proportional above 24 MW)

| Net Income | CASS Due |
|------------|----------|
| < 24,300 RON | 0 RON |
| 24,300 - 48,600 RON | 2,430 RON |
| 48,600 - 97,200 RON | 4,860 RON |
| 97,200 - 291,600 RON | **10% of real income** |
| > 291,600 RON | 29,160 RON (capped at 72 MW) |

**Key Correction**: CASS calculations use the January 1st minimum wage (4,050 RON), NOT the average. This is the legally correct value per Codul Fiscal.

## 3. Declarație Unică Filer Estimates

### Who Must File?

| Category | Total | Likely Filers | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Rental income | 250,000 | 25,000-50,000 | Only high-income landlords |
| Stocks/bonds | 246,000 | 26,000-50,000 | Un-withheld gains or high-income |
| Investment funds | 1,000,000 | 50,000-100,000 | Only above CASS threshold |
| Dividends (domestic) | 450,000 | 45,000-90,000 | 50% overlap with stocks |
| Foreign investments | 50,000-100,000 | 50,000-100,000 | All must file |
| Crypto | 600,000 | ~90,000 | 15% filing probability |
| PFA | 380,000-430,000 | 200,000-300,000 | Most above thresholds |

### Adjusted Totals (with overlaps)

| Scenario | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Lower bound | ~280,000 unique filers |
| Upper bound | ~460,000 unique filers |
| With PFA included | ~500,000-700,000 unique filers |

---

## 4. Counter-Arguments & Risks

### Numbers May Be Lower Because:

1. **Most investment fund income is taxed at source** - no filing needed
2. **Fidelis/Tezaur bonds are 100% tax-exempt** - ~22% of BVB investors
3. **Low compliance for crypto** - 15% filing rate is optimistic
4. **CASS threshold filters out small investors** - most retail investors below 24,300 RON

### Numbers May Be Higher Because:

1. **Undeclared rentals** - possibly 2-3x more than official count
2. **Foreign broker usage growing** - IBKR, Trading212, eToro require filing
3. **Crypto adoption accelerating** - 2M+ registered holders
4. **ANAF enforcement increasing** - more people will file to avoid penalties

---

## 5. Business Opportunity Assessment

### Addressable Market

- **Conservative**: 280,000-460,000 potential filers
- **With PFA**: 500,000-700,000 potential filers
- **Growth rate**: ~20-30% YoY (based on investor growth)

### Revenue Model (impoziteonline.ro)

| Adoption | Users | Fee/Filing | Annual Revenue |

| 5% | 25,000 | 50 RON | 1,250,000 RON (~250k EUR) |
| 10% | 50,000 | 50 RON | 2,500,000 RON (~500k EUR) |
| 20% | 100,000 | 50 RON | 5,000,000 RON (~1M EUR) |

### Competitive Advantages Needed

1. **Simple UI** - step-by-step questionnaire
2. **ANAF XML/PDF export** - ready for submission
3. **Multi-income support** - rent + stocks + crypto + dividends
4. **CASS calculator** - automatic threshold detection
5. **Foreign broker support** - IBKR, Trading212 statement import

### Domain: impoziteonline.ro

**Assessment**: Strong choice
- Clear & descriptive
- .ro TLD = local trust

## 6. Conclusion

The market sizing from the ChatGPT conversation is **roughly accurate** with these corrections:

| Claim | Verdict | Correction |
|-------|---------|------------|
| ~262,700 stock investors | Close | ~246,000 (March 2025) |
| ~1,000,000 fund investors | Correct | 1,007,481 (June 2025) |
| ~600,000 crypto investors | Correct | Confirmed by AAF president |
| CASS threshold 48,000 RON | Wrong | 6 MW = 24,300 RON (first bracket) |
| 280,000-460,000 filers | Reasonable | Conservative estimate |

**Recommendation**: The numbers support building a tax filing service. Key differentiator should be multi-income support (especially crypto + foreign brokers) and simple CASS calculation.
